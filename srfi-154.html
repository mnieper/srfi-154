    <h1>Title</h1>
    
    First-class dynamic environments

    <h1>Author</h1>

    Marc Nieper-Wi&szlig;kirchen

    <h1>Status</h1>
    
    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    Scheme has the notion of the <em>dynamic extent</em> of a
    procedure call.  A number of standard Scheme procedures and
    syntaxes
    like <code>dynamic-wind</code>, <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>,
    and <code>parameterize</code>
    deal with the dynamic extent indirectly.

    This SRFI reifies the dynamic extent into a first-class value
    together with a well-defined procedural interface and a syntax to
    create procedures that remember not only the environment at
    creation time but also their dynamic environment. 

    <h1>Issues</h1>

    <p><code>closed-lambda</code> might be in need for a better name.</p>

    <h1>Rationale</h1>

    <p>
      While the Scheme language is rich enough to reify the concept of
      the dynamic extent and of the dynamic environment of a procedure
      &mdash; the sample implementation accompanying this SRFI is a
      proof of this fact &mdash;, there is no standard on how such a
      reification is exposed to the user.  It is the purpose of this
      SRFI to remedy this.
    </p>

    <p>
      To give an example why explicit handling of dynamic environments
      can become necessary, let us consider the following two definitions:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (define (safe-sqrt error-handler)
    (lambda (x)
      (when (negative? x) 
        (error-handler "negative argument"))
      (sqrt x)))

  (define (error-handler msg)
      (display msg (current-error-port))
      (newline (current-error-port))
      'error)

  (define my-safe-sqrt (safe-sqrt error-handler))
    </pre>
  
    <p>
      When <code>(my-safe-sqrt -1)</code> is executed, an error
      message is printed on the current error port of the call
      to <code>my-safe-sqrt</code>.  It may, however, have been the
      intention of the user that the message is printed to whatever
      error port was current when the
      procedure <code>error-handler</code> was defined.  Using the
      syntax of this SRFI, this can be achieved by changing the
      definition of <code>errror-handler</code> into:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (define error-handler  
    (closed-lambda (msg)
      (display msg (current-error-port))
      (newline (current-error-port))
      'error))
    </pre>      

    <p>
      The same goes not only for error handlers, but for any other
      type of callback procedure where it often makes sense to
      reinstate the dynamic environment of the definition of the
      callback for the dynamic extent of the call to the
      callback, <i>e.g.</i> to define the callback
      using <code>closed-lambda</code> as opposed to using a
      bare <code>lambda</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case the error handler from the example above wants to call
      back on a provided continuation, we have to be a bit more
      careful so that the continuation is called in the expected
      dynamic environment:
    </p>

    <pre>
  (define (safe-sqrt error-handler)
    (lambda (x)
      (when (negative? x) 
        (error-handler "negative argument" exit))
      (sqrt x)))
  
  (define error-handler
    (let ((dynamic-environment (current-dynamic-environment)))
      (lambda (msg exit)
        (with-dynamic-environment dynamic-environment
         (lambda () 
           (display msg (current-error-port))
           (newline (current-error-port))))
        (exit 'error))))

  (define my-safe-sqrt (safe-sqrt error-handler))
    </pre>
      
    <p>Another use case
    is <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scheme-reports-wg2/CQslZcWTXHM/qBMgusbkBAAJ">the
    proper implementation of promises</a> and lazy algorithms that
    work well in the presence
    of <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> and
    dynamically-scoped variables.  (A forthcoming planned SRFI will
    cover promises in this respect.)
    </p>
    
    <h1>Specification</h1>

    <p>
      Throughout, we use the term <em>dynamic environment</em> for a reified
      dynamic extent.  In this sense, the <code><em>before</em></code>
      thunk of a call to <code>dynamic-wind</code>
      sets up the dynamic environment of the call
      to <code><em>thunk</em></code>, while
      the <code><em>after</em></code> thunk restores the dynamic
      environment of the call to <code>dynamic-wind</code>.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Dynamic environments form a type not necessarily disjoint from
      other Scheme types.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Procedures</h2>
    
    <p><code>(dynamic-environment? <em>obj</em></code>)</p>

    <p>
      The <code>dynamic-environment?</code> procedure
      returns <code>#t</code> if its argument is a dynamic environment,
      and <code>#f</code> otherwise.  Note that promises are not
      necessarily disjoint from other Scheme types such as procedures.
    </p>

    <p><code>(current-dynamic-environment)</code></p>

    <p>
      The <code>current-dynamic-environment</code> procedure returns
      the current dynamic environment by capturing the dynamic extent
      of the call to <code>current-dynamic-environment</code>, which
      can be reinstated by the
      procedure <code>with-dynamic-environment</code>.
    </p>

    <p><code>(with-dynamic-environment <em>dynamic-environment</em> <em>thunk</em>)</code></p>

    <p>
      The <code>with-dynamic-environment</code> procedure calls
      the <code><em>thunk</em></code> and returns the values yielded
      by <code><em>thunk</em></code>.  The call
      to <code><em>thunk</em></code> happens in the dynamic extent
      captured by the <code><em>dynamic-environment</em></code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    
    <p><code>(closed-lambda &lt;formals&gt; &lt;body&gt;)</code></p>

    <p>A <code>closed-lambda</code> expression is equivalent
      to <code>lambda</code> expression except that not only the
      environment but also the dynamic environment in effect when the
      <code>closed-lambda</code> expression was evaluated is
      remembered.

      In other words, the expression <code>(closed-lambda
      &lt;formals&gt; &lt;body&gt;)</code> closes also over the
      dynamic environment.      
    </p>
    
    <h1>Implementation</h1>

    <p>
      The <a href="srfi/154.sld">sample implementation</a> is provided
      as an R7RS-library.  It should be easily adaptable to any Scheme
      implementation as long as that implementation has a concept of
      dynamic extents,
      provides <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>, and has a
      macro facility (for implementing <code>closed-lambda</code>).
